# package
I was in need of an application to create die cuts for packaging products, but I couldn't find one.
So I decided to create one on my own.
## Why Javascript?
At first I wanted to use C, but with it I would have to build the GUI with an additional library and I would have to care about platform independence. So I chose HTML, CSS and Javascript so the only thing you would need is an http server on your machine or a webserver to host it.
